Build a voucher management system for a South African supermarket called "SuperSave".

## WHAT IT DOES:
- Tracks R50 paper vouchers with unique barcodes
- Staff scan voucher barcode → instantly marked as "redeemed"
- Management needs full accountability (millions of Rands at stake)

## TECH STACK:
- Frontend: React with Tailwind CSS
- Backend: Supabase (I have an account - will provide keys)
- Authentication: Supabase Auth (email/password login)

## DATABASE TABLES NEEDED:

1. vouchers table:
   - id (auto-generated)
   - barcode (unique string)
   - value (number, default 50)
   - status (enum: 'available', 'redeemed', 'expired', 'voided')
   - batch_number (string)
   - created_at (timestamp)
   - redeemed_at (timestamp, nullable)
   - redeemed_by (user id, nullable)

2. audit_log table:
   - id (auto-generated)
   - action (string: 'created', 'redeemed', 'voided', etc.)
   - voucher_id (reference)
   - user_id (who did it)
   - timestamp
   - details (JSON for extra info)

## PAGES NEEDED:

1. Login page - email/password authentication
2. Dashboard - show voucher stats (total, available, redeemed today)
3. Scan/Redeem page - input barcode, instantly mark as redeemed
4. Vouchers list - view all vouchers, filter by status
5. Import page - upload CSV to bulk-add voucher barcodes
6. Reports page - redemption history with date filters

## CRITICAL FEATURES:

1. INSTANT REDEMPTION:
   - User enters/scans barcode
   - System checks if voucher exists and is "available"
   - If yes: mark as "redeemed", record timestamp + user, show success
   - If already redeemed: show error with who/when it was redeemed
   - If not found: show "Voucher not found" error

2. SECURITY:
   - All pages require login (no public access)
   - Enable Row Level Security on all Supabase tables
   - Only authenticated users can read/write data
   - Log every action to audit_log

3. PROTECTED ROUTES:
   - Redirect to login if not authenticated
   - Show user's email in header
   - Logout button that clears session

## DESIGN:
- Clean, professional look
- Mobile-friendly (staff will use phones to scan)
- Green color scheme (SuperSave brand)
- Large, clear buttons for scanning

## DO NOT:
- Do NOT create any "tills" or "allocations" features
- Do NOT use Railway - use Supabase
- Do NOT expose any API keys in frontend code

Start by setting up the Supabase connection and authentication, then build the pages one by one.
